The AVECS implementation code is provided here. Since the code for the MAPPO algorithm was obtained from the author’s senior fellow student, the author does not hold the copyright to this part. The author has consulted the senior fellow student, who declined to make this portion of the code public. Thus, the author has only retained the code for the Byzantine defense module in the MAPPO-related section (see simulation/network/MAPPO.py for details), while providing all the remaining complete code.
