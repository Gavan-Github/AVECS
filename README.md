The AVECS implementation code is provided here. However, since the original author of the MAPPO implementation does not intend to open-source the code, the MAPPO-related components must be implemented independently (there are many discussions/threads online for reference). In our MAPPO setting, the Byzantine attack and detection modules were implemented by the author, therefore the corresponding code is not released.
